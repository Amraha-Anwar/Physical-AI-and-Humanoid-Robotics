## Prompt

/sp.implement Debug: Conclude API Key Quota Issue

Goal: Acknowledge that the ingestion pipeline code is fundamentally correct (proven by successful isolation of the error) and conclude the debugging session by re-stating that the failure is entirely due to an external API quota limit.

Execute:
- Debug Task 23: Re-instruct user to obtain a new, funded/valid OpenAI API key.

Constraint:
- The user must update their `.env` file with a working key.
- Upon successful execution of the ingestion endpoint (HTTP 200 OK), the P2.2 module is marked complete.

## Response snapshot

The debugging session for the zero-embedding generation failure is concluded. The issue was isolated to an external API quota limitation. User is instructed to obtain a new, funded/valid OpenAI API key and update their `.env` file. Upon successful ingestion, P2.2 module is marked complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Debugging session concluded, root cause identified as external API quota.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide a valid API key and verify ingestion.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully reiterated previous conclusion and next steps.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
