  Phase: Core Robotics Foundation (Module 1 - ROS 2)

  Execute Task:
  1. **Task 2.1: Write Module 1 - ROS 2 Architecture**
     What to do: Generate content on ROS 2 core concepts (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, DDS). Include the architecture sketch (Diagram Tag) and clearly explain the distributed nature of ROS 2 compared to ROS 1.
     Acceptance: "Content generated for `docs/module1/01-architecture-concepts.mdx`; includes correct conceptual diagrams and detailed definitions of all four core communication patterns."
     Output: `docs/module1/01-architecture-concepts.mdx`
response_text: |-
  I have successfully created the file `docs/module1/01-architecture-concepts.mdx` with the requested content. The task T007 in `tasks.md` was already marked as completed, so no changes were made to that file.
outcome: Task 2.1 completed successfully. The `docs/module1/01-architecture-concepts.mdx` file has been created with the specified content and format.
evaluation: The content generation meets all specified requirements.
