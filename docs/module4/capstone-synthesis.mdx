# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

Congratulations! You have built the Nervous System (Module 1), the Digital Twin (Module 2), the Brain (Module 3), and the Mind (Module 4). Now we assemble them.

## 3.1 System Architecture

The final architecture consists of 4 parallel processes running on the Jetson Orin:

1.  **`hardware_interface`**: Talks to motors, reads IMU (1000Hz).
2.  **`nav2_stack`**: Plans paths using the VSLAM map (20Hz).
3.  **`vslam_node`**: Localizes the robot using RealSense (30Hz).
4.  **`cognitive_planner`**: Listens for voice commands (Event-based).

## 3.2 The Sim-to-Real Gap

We trained our VSLAM map and tested our Cognitive Planner in simulation (Isaac Sim). Now we must transfer these assets to the physical robot.

### Deployment Script (`deploy_to_robot.sh`)

We use `rsync` to efficiently synchronize our workspace.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy_to_robot.sh

ROBOT_IP="192.168.1.100"
USER="robot_user"
WS_LOCAL="~/ros2_ws/src"
WS_REMOTE="~/ros2_ws/src"

echo "Deploying code to $USER@$ROBOT_IP..."

# 1. Sync Source Code
rsync -avz --delete \
    --exclude '.git' \
    --exclude 'build' \
    --exclude 'install' \
    --exclude 'log' \
    $WS_LOCAL/my_humanoid_pkg $USER@$ROBOT_IP:$WS_REMOTE

# 2. Sync Maps (Simulated maps used for initial testing)
rsync -avz $WS_LOCAL/../maps $USER@$ROBOT_IP:~/ros2_ws/

# 3. Remote Build
ssh $USER@$ROBOT_IP "cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon build --packages-select my_humanoid_pkg && source install/setup.bash"

echo "Deployment Complete. Ready to launch."
```

## 3.3 Running the Capstone

1.  **SSH into Robot**: `ssh robot_user@<IP>`
2.  **Launch Base**: `ros2 launch my_humanoid_pkg robot_base.launch.py` (Motors + Sensors)
3.  **Launch Intelligence**: `ros2 launch my_humanoid_pkg cognitive_brain.launch.py` (Nav2 + VSLAM + Voice)
4.  **Interact**:
    *   *You*: "Robot, go to the living room."
    *   *Robot*: (Transcribes audio -> Plans path -> Executes Nav2 goal).

## 3.4 Final Words

You have traversed the path from basic nodes to a fully embodied intelligent agent. The field of Humanoid Robotics is evolving rapidly. Use this foundation to explore **Reinforcement Learning** for dynamic running or **Manipulation** for household tasks.
