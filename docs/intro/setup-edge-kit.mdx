# Setup Guide: Physical AI Edge Kit

While the workstation handles simulation, the **Edge Kit** is the physical brain that rides inside the robot. It processes real-world sensor data and makes decisions in milliseconds.

## 3.1 Hardware Components

*   **Compute Module**: **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** (8GB Developer Kit).
    *   *Role*: Runs the ROS 2 navigation stack, VLA nodes, and sensor drivers.
*   **Vision Sensor**: **Intel RealSense D435i**.
    *   *Role*: Provides RGB, Depth, and IMU data for SLAM.
*   **Storage**: 512GB NVMe SSD (M.2 Key M).
    *   *Requirement*: High-speed IO is critical for recording ROS bags.
*   **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi 6 Module (M.2 Key E).

## 3.2 Flashing JetPack 6 (Ubuntu 22.04)

The Jetson Orin Nano runs **JetPack**, NVIDIA's SDK which includes the Linux OS (Ubuntu 22.04 for JetPack 6), CUDA, TensorRT, and ROS 2 support.

1.  **Prepare Host Machine**: On your Workstation (from Chapter 2), install **NVIDIA SDK Manager**.
2.  **Force Recovery Mode**: Jumper the Force Recovery pins on the Orin Nano carrier board and connect via USB-C to the host.
3.  **Flash OS**:
    *   Select "Jetson Orin Nano" in SDK Manager.
    *   Choose **JetPack 6.0** (or latest compatible with Ubuntu 22.04).
    *   Select "Flash" to write the OS to the NVMe SSD.
4.  **First Boot**: Connect a monitor/keyboard to the Jetson setup the user account (`robot_user`) and Wi-Fi.

## 3.3 Headless Setup (SSH)

For a humanoid robot, you won't have a monitor attached during operation. We must configure remote access.

1.  **Find IP Address**: Run `ip addr` on the Jetson.
2.  **Connect from Workstation**:
    ```bash
    ssh robot_user@<JETSON_IP_ADDRESS>
    ```
3.  **Setup Keys**: Generate SSH keys on your workstation (`ssh-keygen`) and copy them to the Jetson (`ssh-copy-id`) for password-less login.

## 3.4 Installing Isaac ROS Prerequisites

NVIDIA provides a Docker-based workflow for Isaac ROS to ensure hardware acceleration works out of the box.

1.  **Install Nvidia Container Toolkit**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
2.  **Configure Docker**:
    Ensure your user is in the docker group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker
    ```
3.  **Clone Isaac ROS Common**:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src
    cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common.git
    ```

## 3.5 Verifying the RealSense Camera

1.  Connect the D435i to a USB 3.0 port (blue) on the Jetson.
2.  Install `realsense-viewer`:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install librealsense2-utils
    realsense-viewer
    ```
3.  *Success Criteria*: You should see live streams of RGB and Depth data. If the FPS is low, ensure you are using a high-quality USB-C cable.

In **Module 4**, you will deploy the VLA node to this Jetson. The Sim-to-Real scripts will assume this exact directory structure and SSH access.
