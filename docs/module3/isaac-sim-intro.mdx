# Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim

While Gazebo is excellent for physics, **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** is the gold standard for photorealism and synthetic data generation. It allows us to train AI models on data that looks nearly identical to the real world.

## 1.1 What is Isaac Sim?

Isaac Sim is built on **NVIDIA Omniverse**, a platform for creating metaverse applications.
*   **Rendering**: Uses RTX Ray Tracing for realistic light, shadows, and reflections.
*   **Physics**: Uses PhysX 5 for high-fidelity rigid and soft body simulation.
*   **ROS 2 Bridge**: Seamlessly connects to our ROS 2 nodes.

## 1.2 Why use it for Humanoids?

1.  **Perception Training**: Our VLA models need to "see" objects (cups, doors) realistically. Gazebo's simple graphics are insufficient for training robust vision models.
2.  **Domain Randomization**: We can automatically vary the lighting, textures, and object positions in Isaac Sim to create infinite training datasets. This prevents the robot from overfitting to a single environment.

## 1.3 Setting up the ROS 2 Bridge

To talk to our existing ROS 2 architecture, we enable the Omniverse ROS 2 Bridge extension.

1.  **Launch Isaac Sim**.
2.  Go to **Window -> Extensions**.
3.  Search for `omni.isaac.ros2_bridge` and enable it.

### Verifying the Bridge

Create a simple Python script inside Isaac Sim's Script Editor to publish a message:

```python
import rclpy
from std_msgs.msg import String

def publish_hello():
    rclpy.init()
    node = rclpy.create_node('isaac_sim_talker')
    pub = node.create_publisher(String, '/chatter', 10)
    msg = String()
    msg.data = "Hello from Omniverse!"
    pub.publish(msg)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

publish_hello()
```

Run a listener in your terminal: `ros2 topic echo /chatter`. You should receive the message.

## 1.4 Importing URDF into Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim has a dedicated URDF Importer tool.
1.  **Isaac Utils -> Workflows -> URDF Importer**.
2.  Select your `humanoid.urdf`.
3.  Check **Fix Base Link** (for static testing) or uncheck it (for dynamics).
4.  Click **Import**.

Your robot will appear in the photorealistic scene, ready for VSLAM training.
