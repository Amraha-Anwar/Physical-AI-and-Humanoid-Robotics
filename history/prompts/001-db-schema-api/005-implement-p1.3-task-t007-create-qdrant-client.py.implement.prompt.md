Goal: Implement the first step of the Qdrant client setup.

Execute:
- T2.1 Create the `backend/qdrant_client.py` file.

Constraint:
- The file must be placed in the `backend/` directory.
## Response snapshot

Created the `backend/qdrant_client.py` file. Marked T007 as completed in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The initial file for Qdrant client implementation (`backend/qdrant_client.py`) has been created.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this task as it only involves file creation.
- 📁 Files: `backend/qdrant_client.py` created, `specs/001-db-schema-api/tasks.md` updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with subsequent implementation tasks for P1.3.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully executed the file creation task and updated task status.
