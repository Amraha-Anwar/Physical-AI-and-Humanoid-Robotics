  Phase: Core Robotics Foundation (Module 1 - ROS 2)

  Execute Task:
  1. **Task 2.2: Write Module 1 - Packages and rclpy**
     What to do: Generate content on building ROS 2 Python packages (using `colcon`), defining package dependencies (`package.xml`), and creating basic **Publishers** and **Subscribers** using runnable Python code (`rclpy`).
     Acceptance: "Content generated for `docs/module1/02-packages-rclpy.mdx`; includes complete, runnable Python code examples for a talker/listener pair and correct ROS 2 package creation guidance."
     Output: `docs/module1/02-packages-rclpy.mdx`
response_text: |-
  I have successfully created the file `docs/module1/02-packages-rclpy.mdx` with the requested content and code examples. The task T008 in `tasks.md` was already marked as completed, so no changes were made to that file.
outcome: Task 2.2 completed successfully. The `docs/module1/02-packages-rclpy.mdx` file has been created with the specified content and format.
evaluation: The content generation meets all specified requirements.
